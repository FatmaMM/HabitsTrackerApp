# HabitsTrackerApp
which would allow a user to store and track their habits over time. This project will not have any UI components; instead, you will focus on what happens behind the scenes, practicing how to design and implement a simple database.

# What will I learn?

This project is about combining various ideas and skills weâ€™ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:

   Creating a SQLite table in your app
   Populating that table with new entries
   Modifying the entries
   Displaying the contents of the table to users.
  
  
# Description
    First, define and setup up the database schema (i.e. table and columns) that can be used to help a user keep track of their habits (e.g. walking the dog, practicing the saxophone, taking any medications). 
    Then, create 2 methods that insert and read data to/from your database. These 2 methods can all be contained in a single Java file.
